# Thing

Oh hey it is a thing
Currently consists of

- a very scuffed autograder
  - you upload a file
  - file _will_ is stored in a bucket
  - a grpc call to a python server to grade a file
  - you view the grade

TODO

- ~~Deploy~~ (Did a single server deployment)
- ~~do blob storage (backblaze)~~
- **Remove the technical debt oof**
- allow users to download files (backblaze)

- See how you can directly upload without saving a local copy
- Auth
